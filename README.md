# gamejams-31Mar2021

Thought I'd make a game to kill 3 jams by combining all their themes into 1. 
- Jam1: left 48 hours: Tiny Boat
- Jam2: left 97 hours: Treasure
- Jam3: left 108 hours : Unexpected. 
(Time left as at 1AM Wednesday, 31 March SGT)

What is unexpected, tiny boat and with Treasure? hmmm
